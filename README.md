Print_Joke_API - Run for laughs

In this little programm that I coded a year ago, I made use of the JokeAPI to print out random jokes in a chosen style and language.
I am aware of the official API Wrappers offered on the Website, but I was just introduced to JSON in university and I wanted to implement it myself.
It is just a little gimmick, but at the time I thought it would be fun (and I still do).

Since up until now I only implemented gui's in Java, it is still a command line programm, but now that I am thinking about it, that seems like a good oportunity to get familiar with some simple python gui's and integrate this project into a gui.
